Submission of VBA code homework

I completed the homework requirements from two following steps for each year:
- Step 1: Generate a list of ticker for the year. See file: "Module1 Stock Ticker List.bas"
- Step 2: Look for year open and year close value and then calculate the yearly change and percentage. See file: "Module2 Stock Yearly Change.bas"

Please note:
Currently, I manually apply the VBA code in each worksheet to generate the result. I know I could use worksheet() to automate the process.  I will improve the code in the future.
